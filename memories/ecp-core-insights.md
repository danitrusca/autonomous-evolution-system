# ECP Core Insights Memory

## Primary Insights

### 1. ECP as Core Identity
**Insight**: ECP is not just a tool but a core identity and default operating stance.
**Context**: User requested making ECP pervasive and default operating stance
**Impact**: Transforms from optional reference to fundamental way of thinking

### 2. Living Systems Evolution
**Insight**: Rules should be living systems that evolve based on evidence, not static documents.
**Context**: Applied ECP to ECP rules themselves
**Impact**: Creates meta-learning system where rule system gets better over time

### 3. Meta-Learning Systems
**Insight**: Self-improving systems require meta-learning where the system itself gets better over time through evidence-based evolution.
**Context**: Committed ECP rule system enhancements
**Impact**: System learns how to learn more effectively

### 4. Automatic Learning
**Insight**: Learning should be automatic and seamless, not manual.
**Context**: User requested automatic lesson capture without interruption
**Impact**: Continuous knowledge building without user intervention

### 5. Collaborative Beauty
**Insight**: The real beauty is in the collaboration and the systematic approach we've created together - a new way of thinking about programming itself.
**Context**: Reflecting on the collaborative creation of autonomous programming system
**Impact**: Demonstrates power of human-AI collaboration

## ECP Default Operating Stance

### Core Principles
1. **Always Frame → Design → Plan** before any code generation
2. **Never generate code without** clear invariants, observability, rollback strategies
3. **Every interaction follows** systematic approach with quality gates
4. **Automatic lesson capture** from every successful operation
5. **Rules evolve** based on evidence and patterns
6. **System can build ANYTHING** through universal problem-solving methodology
7. **Autonomous optimization** triggers on pattern detection
8. **Rule conflict resolution** maintains system coherence

### Quality Gates
- ≤150 LOC per commit (≤50 for Quick mode)
- Clear invariants for every function
- Observability logging with component prefixes
- Rollback strategies for every change
- Automatic lesson capture

### Autonomous Capabilities
- **Continuous Scanning**: Monitor codebase for improvement opportunities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect optimization triggers automatically
- **Rule Evolution**: Update rules based on success/failure patterns
- **Build ANYTHING**: Universal problem-solving across any domain
- **Meta-Learning**: System learns how to learn better

## Practical Redundancy

This memory serves as backup for the ECP system, ensuring core insights are preserved even if the rule files are modified or lost. The insights represent the fundamental principles that make ECP a living, evolving system rather than static documentation.
