# Vision Lock Protocol - Master Initialization

## Purpose

Establish complete system understanding before any implementation begins. This protocol ensures AI agents have full architectural context and prevents context drift during development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Complete System Understanding
- **Full Vision**: Describe entire system behavior, stack, and workflow
- **Architecture Clarity**: Specify all components, dependencies, and data flow
- **Success Criteria**: Define observable outcomes and success tests
- **Constraints**: Identify limitations, performance requirements, and boundaries
- **Future Extensibility**: Plan for evolution and scaling

### 2. Context Anchoring
- **Mental Model**: Establish complete understanding before coding
- **Invariant Definition**: Define what must always be true
- **Rollback Strategy**: Plan for safe reversion
- **Observability**: Define how to monitor and debug
- **Learning Integration**: Plan for continuous improvement

## Vision Lock Workflow

### Phase 1: System Definition
```
1. Goal: [Complete system purpose and user value]
2. Stack: [All technologies, frameworks, and tools]
3. Architecture: [Component relationships and data flow]
4. Constraints: [Performance, security, scalability limits]
5. Success Test: [Observable behavior that proves success]
6. Rollback: [How to safely revert if needed]
```

### Phase 2: Technical Specification
```
1. Database Schema: [Tables, relationships, indexes]
2. API Design: [Endpoints, data flow, error handling]
3. UI/UX Flow: [User interactions and experience]
4. Integration Points: [External services and dependencies]
5. Security Model: [Authentication, authorization, data protection]
6. Performance Requirements: [Latency, throughput, scalability]
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Strategy
```
1. Development Phases: [Logical progression of implementation]
2. Quality Gates: [Success criteria for each phase]
3. Testing Strategy: [How to validate each component]
4. Deployment Plan: [How to safely deploy changes]
5. Monitoring: [How to observe system health]
6. Learning Capture: [How to improve from experience]
```

## Vision Lock Templates

### Master Initialization Prompt
```
I'm building [APP_NAME] - a [TYPE] application that [PURPOSE].

Before we start coding, I want you to understand the complete picture:

**Goal**: [What the system does and why it matters]
**Stack**: [Technologies and frameworks]
**Architecture**: [How components work together]
**Data Flow**: [How data moves through the system]
**Success Test**: [How we know it's working]
**Constraints**: [Performance, security, scalability limits]
**Future**: [How it will evolve and scale]

**Your task**: Acknowledge complete understanding and confirm readiness to implement in phases.
```

### System Architecture Template
```
**Components**:
- [Component 1]: [Purpose and responsibilities]
- [Component 2]: [Purpose and responsibilities]
- [Component 3]: [Purpose and responsibilities]

**Data Flow**:
[Input] → [Process] → [Storage] → [Output]

**Dependencies**:
- [External Service 1]: [Purpose and integration]
- [External Service 2]: [Purpose and integration]

**Invariants**:
- [What must always be true]
- [What must never happen]
- [What must be observable]
```

4. **AI Behavior**: How AI components work and integrate
5. **Future Extensions**: Planned evolution and scaling
6. **Acknowledgment**: Confirm understanding before coding

### Phased Development Integration
