# ECP Rules Changelog

## 2024-12-19 - Rule System Analysis and Optimization

### Changes Made

**1. Diagnostic-Autonomous Integration (01-ecp-diagnostics.md)**
- **Context**: Diagnostic rules were isolated from autonomous optimization
- **Change**: Added autonomous integration section that triggers optimization when patterns are detected
- **Expected Impact**: Automatic optimization when repeated issues are found
- **Success Metrics**: Reduced manual intervention for recurring problems

**2. Rule Conflict Resolution (10-rule-conflict-resolution.md)**
- **Context**: No mechanism to detect or resolve conflicts between rules
- **Change**: Created comprehensive conflict detection and resolution system
- **Expected Impact**: Prevents contradictory rule behavior and maintains system coherence
- **Success Metrics**: Zero rule conflicts, consistent system behavior

**3. Rule Evolution Meta-System (00-ecp-mode.md)**
- **Context**: Rules were static and didn't evolve based on performance
- **Change**: Added meta-system for rule evolution based on success/failure patterns
- **Expected Impact**: Rules automatically improve over time based on evidence
- **Success Metrics**: Improved rule effectiveness, reduced friction

### Learning Integration
- **Pattern**: Diagnostic → Autonomous → Learning capture
- **Outcome**: System now automatically learns from problems and applies solutions
- **Insight**: Rules should be living systems that evolve, not static documents

### Rollback Plan
- Revert 01-ecp-diagnostics.md to remove autonomous integration
- Delete 10-rule-conflict-resolution.md
- Remove rule evolution meta-system from 00-ecp-mode.md

## 2024-12-19 - Automatic Lesson Capture Enhancement

### Changes Made

**4. Enhanced Automatic Learning Capture (00-ecp-mode.md)**
- **Context**: User requested automatic lesson capture without manual intervention
- **Change**: Enhanced automatic learning capture with clear triggers, format, and scope
- **Expected Impact**: Continuous knowledge building without user interruption
- **Success Metrics**: All successful operations automatically captured in AUTONOMOUS_EVOLUTION_JOURNAL.md

### Learning Integration
- **Pattern**: Every successful operation → Automatic lesson capture
- **Outcome**: Continuous knowledge building and system improvement
- **Insight**: Learning should be automatic and seamless, not manual

## 2024-12-19 - Double Pass Protocol Implementation

### Changes Made

**5. Double Pass Collaboration System (11-double-pass-protocol.md)**
- **Context**: User has access to two AI agents (ECP + ChatGPT Codex) for collaboration
- **Change**: Created comprehensive dual-agent collaboration protocol for meta-learning
- **Expected Impact**: Enhanced quality through dual validation and agent-to-agent learning
- **Success Metrics**: Final output exceeds individual agent capabilities

### Learning Integration
- **Pattern**: Primary Agent → Secondary Agent → Integration → Learning → Optimization
- **Outcome**: Meta-learning system where agents learn from each other
- **Insight**: Dual-agent collaboration enables enhanced quality and autonomous optimization through creative tension

Track protocol evolution: upgrades, deletions, and friction learnings.

## 2025-10-14

**Initialized RSI Loop**
- Added recursive self-improvement mechanics to 00-ecp-mode.md (Gating Checks, Micro-Loop, Daily Review, Weekly Audit, Drift Guard, KPIs).
- Updated 02-ecp-commit-contract.md to reference orchestrator (00).
- Added `/ecp review` and `/ecp audit` macros to 03-ecp-macros.md.
- Created AUTONOMOUS_EVOLUTION_JOURNAL.md for comprehensive learning capture and system evolution tracking.
- Created this RULES_CHANGELOG.md.

**Expected effect**: Every commit now has a learning capture path; protocol can self-upgrade based on friction patterns.

## 2025-10-14 (later)

**Added Initialization Checklist**
- Created `.cursor/rules/05-ecp-initialization-checklist.md` via first `/ecp review` suggestion.
- Defines repeatable baseline setup for ECP across projects.
- Establishes invariant: future micro-reviews can measure change velocity vs. baseline.

**Expected effect**: New projects can bootstrap ECP consistently; KPI tracking starts from known-good state.

## 2025-10-14 (micro-review)

**Added Mode Selection Guide**
- Created `.cursor/rules/06-ecp-mode-selection-guide.md` via `/ecp review` suggestion.
- Provides decision matrix for Quick/Standard/Emergency mode selection.
- Reduces decision fatigue and prevents over-engineering simple tasks.

**Expected effect**: Clear guidance for mode selection improves developer experience and maintains appropriate rigor.

## 2025-10-14 (v2.2)

**Added Quick/Emergency Macros (Commit 2)**
- Minimal macro definitions appended to 03-ecp-macros.md
- Added /quick and /emergency entries for ECP v2 modes
- Maintains format consistency with existing macro definitions

**Expected effect**: Quick/Emergency modes now callable by ECP Orchestrator.

## 2025-10-14 (debugging)

**Supabase Diagnostic Success**
- Enhanced `/api/db-check` route with detailed environment logging
- Isolated `TypeError: fetch failed` to missing/invalid environment variables
- Added network connectivity test before Supabase client creation
- Resolved by creating `.env.local` and restarting dev server

**Expected effect**: Future `fetch failed` errors in Node.js can be diagnosed with environment variable checks first.
