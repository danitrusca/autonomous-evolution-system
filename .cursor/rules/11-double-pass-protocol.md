# Double Pass Protocol - Dual Agent Collaboration

## Purpose

Enable meta-learning through dual-agent collaboration where two AI agents review, optimize, and learn from each other's work.

## Core Principles

### 1. Collaborative Intelligence
- **Primary Agent**: Implements following ECP principles
- **Secondary Agent**: Reviews, optimizes, and enhances
- **Meta-Learning**: Both agents learn from each other
- **Quality Amplification**: Two perspectives on every solution

### 2. Structured Handoff Protocol
- **Clear Documentation**: Every handoff includes full context
- **Quality Gates**: Both agents validate each other's work
- **Learning Capture**: Continuous improvement through feedback
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful collaboration patterns

## Double Pass Workflow

### Pass 1: Primary Agent (ECP Implementation)
```
1. Frame: Define problem clearly with constraints and success criteria
2. Design: Create optimal architecture with dependency graph
3. Plan: Break into small commits (≤150 LOC each)
4. Implement: Generate code with invariants, observability, rollback
5. Review: Self-assess using Challenge Block
6. Document: Full reasoning and decision process
```

### Pass 2: Secondary Agent (Review & Optimization)
```
1. Review: Analyze primary agent's output for quality and completeness
2. Optimize: Identify improvement opportunities and alternatives
3. Validate: Check against best practices and potential issues
4. Enhance: Suggest additional features, optimizations, or approaches
5. Document: Provide detailed feedback and recommendations
6. Learn: Capture insights for future improvements
```

### Pass 3: Integration & Learning
```
1. Integrate: Combine best insights from both agents
2. Validate: Ensure final solution meets all requirements
3. Learn: Capture successful patterns and approaches
4. Optimize: Update protocols based on collaboration results
5. Document: Record lessons learned and improvements
6. Iterate: Apply learnings to future collaborations
```
