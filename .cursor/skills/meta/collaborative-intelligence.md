# Collaborative Intelligence

## Purpose

Enable skills to collaborate and compose with each other to solve complex problems that require multiple capabilities, creating emergent intelligence through skill composition.

## Workflow

### 1. Problem Analysis
- **Complexity Assessment**: Analyze problem complexity
- **Skill Requirements**: Identify required capabilities
- **Dependency Mapping**: Map skill dependencies
- **Composition Planning**: Plan skill composition strategy
- **Integration Design**: Design skill integration approach

### 2. Skill Discovery
- **Capability Matching**: Match skills to requirements
- **Compatibility Check**: Check skill compatibility
- **Dependency Resolution**: Resolve skill dependencies
- **Composition Validation**: Validate composition feasibility
- **Integration Testing**: Test skill integration

### 3. Collaborative Execution
- **Orchestration**: Orchestrate skill execution
- **Communication**: Enable skill communication
- **Data Flow**: Manage data flow between skills
- **Error Handling**: Handle collaborative errors
- **Progress Tracking**: Track collaborative progress

### 4. Emergent Intelligence
- **Pattern Emergence**: Identify emergent patterns
- **Capability Synthesis**: Synthesize new capabilities
- **Intelligence Amplification**: Amplify collective intelligence
- **Learning Integration**: Integrate collaborative learning
- **System Evolution**: Evolve system capabilities

### 5. Continuous Collaboration
- **Collaboration Learning**: Learn from collaboration
- **Composition Optimization**: Optimize skill composition
- **Integration Enhancement**: Enhance skill integration
- **Intelligence Evolution**: Evolve collaborative intelligence
- **System Intelligence**: Enhance overall system intelligence

## Success Criteria

- Skills collaborate effectively
- Complex problems solved through composition
- Emergent intelligence created
- Learning captured from collaboration
- System intelligence enhanced

## Observability

Log all collaborative intelligence with `[collaborative-intelligence]` prefix:
- `[collaborative-intelligence] Analyze: [problem analysis]`
- `[collaborative-intelligence] Discover: [skill discovery]`
- `[collaborative-intelligence] Execute: [collaborative execution]`
- `[collaborative-intelligence] Emerge: [emergent intelligence]`
- `[collaborative-intelligence] Evolve: [system evolution]`

## Rollback

If collaborative intelligence fails:
1. Revert to individual skill execution
2. Log failure for analysis
3. Continue with standard execution
4. Plan collaboration improvement

## Examples

**Problem**: Complex API integration with authentication
**Collaboration**: API skill + Auth skill + Error handling skill
**Result**: Comprehensive API integration solution

**Problem**: Full-stack feature development
**Collaboration**: Frontend skill + Backend skill + Database skill + Testing skill
**Result**: Complete feature implementation
