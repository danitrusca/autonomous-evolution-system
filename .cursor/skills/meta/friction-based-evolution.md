# Friction-Based Evolution

## Purpose

Evolve system based on AI friction patterns to optimize problem-solving capabilities and ensure continuous improvement.

## Workflow

### 1. Friction Pattern Analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring friction patterns
- **Impact Assessment**: Assess friction impact on problem-solving
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine underlying causes of friction
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze friction trends over time
- **Priority Ranking**: Rank friction by importance and frequency

### 2. Evolution Planning
- **Short-term Evolution**: Plan immediate friction reduction
- **Medium-term Evolution**: Plan systematic improvements
- **Long-term Evolution**: Plan fundamental system changes
- **Capability Enhancement**: Plan new capability development
- **System Optimization**: Plan overall system optimization

### 3. Friction-Based Adaptation
- **Skill Simplification**: Simplify skills that cause friction
- **Skill Discovery**: Improve skill discovery and suggestion
- **Skill Composition**: Enhance skill integration and orchestration
- **Skill Generation**: Create new skills to address friction
- **Skill Maintenance**: Update and maintain skills proactively

### 4. System Evolution
- **Architecture Evolution**: Evolve system architecture
- **Interface Evolution**: Evolve user interfaces
- **Learning Evolution**: Evolve learning mechanisms
- **Integration Evolution**: Evolve skill integration
- **Performance Evolution**: Evolve system performance

### 5. Continuous Improvement
- **Friction Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for friction
- **Evolution Application**: Apply planned evolution
- **Performance Measurement**: Measure evolution effectiveness
- **Feedback Integration**: Integrate feedback into evolution
- **System Optimization**: Continuously optimize system

## Success Criteria

- Friction patterns are analyzed and understood
- System evolution is planned and executed
- AI problem-solving is optimized
- Friction is continuously reduced
- System capabilities are enhanced

## Observability

Log all friction-based evolution with `[friction-based-evolution]` prefix:
- `[friction-based-evolution] Analyze: [friction pattern analysis]`
- `[friction-based-evolution] Plan: [evolution planning]`
- `[friction-based-evolution] Adapt: [friction-based adaptation]`
- `[friction-based-evolution] Evolve: [system evolution]`
- `[friction-based-evolution] Improve: [continuous improvement]`

## Rollback

If friction-based evolution fails:
1. Revert to previous system state
2. Log failure for analysis
3. Continue with existing system
4. Plan evolution improvement

## Examples

**Friction Pattern**: AI struggles to find API debugging skills
**Analysis**: Skill discovery friction, missing API debugging capabilities
**Evolution**: Create comprehensive API debugging skill, improve skill discovery
**Result**: AI can efficiently debug API issues

**Friction Pattern**: Skills are too complex for quick problem-solving
**Analysis**: Skill execution friction, overly complex interfaces
**Evolution**: Simplify skill interfaces, add quick-start modes
**Result**: AI can use skills efficiently for rapid problem-solving
