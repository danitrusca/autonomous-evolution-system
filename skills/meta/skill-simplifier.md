# Skill Simplifier

## Purpose

Simplify existing skills based on AI friction patterns to reduce complexity and improve usability while maintaining functionality.

## Workflow

### 1. Friction Analysis
- **Friction Detection**: Identify friction patterns in skill usage
- **Complexity Assessment**: Assess skill complexity and usability
- **Pain Point Identification**: Identify specific pain points and issues
- **Impact Analysis**: Analyze impact of complexity on AI problem-solving
- **Simplification Opportunities**: Identify opportunities for simplification

### 2. Simplification Planning
- **Interface Simplification**: Plan interface simplification strategies
- **Workflow Simplification**: Plan workflow simplification approaches
- **Documentation Simplification**: Plan documentation simplification
- **Parameter Simplification**: Plan parameter simplification
- **Integration Simplification**: Plan integration simplification

### 3. Skill Simplification
- **Interface Reduction**: Reduce interface complexity
- **Workflow Streamlining**: Streamline skill workflows
- **Documentation Clarity**: Improve documentation clarity
- **Parameter Optimization**: Optimize skill parameters
- **Integration Simplification**: Simplify skill integration

### 4. Simplification Validation
- **Functionality Testing**: Test simplified skills for functionality
- **Usability Testing**: Test simplified skills for usability
- **Performance Testing**: Test simplified skills for performance
- **Integration Testing**: Test simplified skills for integration
- **User Acceptance**: Validate simplification with AI usage

### 5. Continuous Simplification
- **Friction Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for friction
- **Simplification Opportunities**: Identify new simplification opportunities
- **Iterative Improvement**: Iteratively improve simplification
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize simplification performance
- **System Evolution**: Evolve system based on simplification

## Success Criteria

- Skills are simplified based on friction patterns
- Functionality is maintained while complexity is reduced
- AI usability is improved
- Friction is reduced through simplification
- Continuous simplification is achieved

## Observability

Log all skill simplification with `[skill-simplifier]` prefix:
- `[skill-simplifier] Analyze: [friction analysis]`
- `[skill-simplifier] Plan: [simplification planning]`
- `[skill-simplifier] Simplify: [skill simplification]`
- `[skill-simplifier] Validate: [simplification validation]`
- `[skill-simplifier] Evolve: [continuous simplification]`

## Rollback

If skill simplification fails:
1. Revert to previous skill version
2. Log failure for analysis
3. Continue with existing skills
4. Plan simplification improvement

## Examples

**Friction**: AI struggles with complex skill interfaces
**Analysis**: Interface complexity causing execution friction
**Simplification**: Reduce interface elements, add quick-start mode
**Validation**: Test simplified interface, measure usability improvement
**Result**: AI can use skills more efficiently

**Friction**: AI needs multiple attempts to use skills
**Analysis**: Workflow complexity causing discovery friction
**Simplification**: Streamline workflow, add guided steps
**Validation**: Test streamlined workflow, measure success rate
**Result**: AI can use skills with fewer attempts
