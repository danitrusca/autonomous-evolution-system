# Build ANYTHING Framework - Universal Problem Solver

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Universal Problem Solver
- **Any Problem**: Break down any programming challenge into solvable components
- **Any Technology**: Adapt to any programming language, framework, or platform
- **Any Scale**: From simple scripts to enterprise systems
- **Any Domain**: Web apps, mobile apps, AI systems, games, IoT, etc.

### 2. Systematic Approach
- **Frame**: Understand the problem deeply and completely
- **Design**: Create optimal architecture and solution strategy
- **Plan**: Break into small, manageable, testable pieces
- **Implement**: Execute with quality gates and continuous optimization
- **Review**: Validate, learn, and evolve

## Build ANYTHING Methodology

### 1. Problem Framing (/frame)
```
- What exactly are we building?
- Who are the users and what are their needs?
- What are the constraints (time, resources, technology)?
- What does success look like?
- What are the risks and how do we mitigate them?
```

### 2. Solution Design (/design)
```
- Architecture: System design and component relationships
- Technology Stack: Choose optimal tools and frameworks
- Data Flow: How information moves through the system
- Security: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- Performance: Scalability, speed, resource optimization
- User Experience: Interface design and interaction patterns
```

### 3. Implementation Planning (/plan)
```
- Break into small, focused commits (â‰¤150 LOC each)
- Define invariants and success tests
- Plan rollback strategies
- Add observability and monitoring
- Create deployment and maintenance procedures
```

### 4. Code Generation (/implement)
```
- Generate high-quality, tested code
- Follow best practices and patterns
- Ensure security and performance
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include documentation and comments
```

### 5. Quality Review (/review)
```
- Validate all requirements are met
- Check performance and security
- Verify tests pass and coverage is adequate
- Ensure documentation is complete
- Plan for continuous improvement
```
