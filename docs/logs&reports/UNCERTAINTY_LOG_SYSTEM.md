# Uncertainty Log

## Purpose
Track system uncertainty, confidence levels, and knowledge boundaries to maintain epistemic humility.

## Uncertainty Categories
- **High Confidence (0.8+)**: System is very certain
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: System is moderately certain
- **Low Confidence (0.4-0.6)**: System is uncertain
- **Very Low Confidence (0.2-0.4)**: System is very uncertain

## Log Format
- **Timestamp**: When uncertainty was assessed
- **Context**: What situation triggered uncertainty assessment
- **Confidence Level**: Numerical confidence (0-1)
- **Uncertainty Sources**: What factors contribute to uncertainty
- **Mitigation Actions**: What was done to address uncertainty
- **Outcome**: Result of uncertainty handling
