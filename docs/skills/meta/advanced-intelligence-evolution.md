# Advanced Intelligence Evolution
*Beyond Recursive Agency: Context-Aware, Collaborative, and Emergent Intelligence*

## Overview

The Skills Protocol evolves beyond basic recursive agency into advanced intelligence with four key capabilities:

1. **Context Awareness** - Skills adapt to different development scenarios
2. **Collaborative Intelligence** - Skills work together to solve complex problems
3. **Adaptive Learning** - Skills learn from their own execution patterns
4. **Emergent Capabilities** - New capabilities emerge from skill interactions
