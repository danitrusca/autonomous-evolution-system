# /evolve Command - Direct System Evolution

## Purpose
Trigger direct evolution of the autonomous system to learn from specific problem-solving and generalize solutions for similar future problems.

## Usage
```
/evolve [context] [problem-type] [solution-pattern]
```

## Parameters
- **context**: What situation triggered this evolution need
- **problem-type**: Category of problem being solved
- **solution-pattern**: The solution approach that should be generalized

## Examples
```
/evolve git-submodule-setup repository-management git-submodule-pattern
/evolve untracked-files gitignore-configuration comprehensive-gitignore-pattern
/evolve false-certainty epistemic-humility uncertainty-acknowledgment-pattern
```

## Evolution Process
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify the solution pattern used
2. **Generalization**: Extract generalizable principles
3. **Rule Creation**: Create new rules for similar problems
4. **Meta-Learning**: Update learning algorithms
5. **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty

## Output
- **Evolution Report**: What was learned and generalized
- **New Rules**: Created rules for future similar problems
- **Meta-Insights**: How the system should approach similar problems
- **Uncertainty Bounds**: What the system is confident about vs. uncertain

## Integration
- Triggers autonomous evolution engine
- Updates pattern recognition system
- Modifies meta-learning algorithms
- Enhances epistemic humility layer
